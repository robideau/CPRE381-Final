# CPRE381-Final
My final project for my processor design course. 

This is a single-cycle MIPS processor with in-order pipeline to handle control and data hazards, all written in VHDL.
I submitted this project with Juan Venegas and Zach Brase for my CprE 381 class in December 2015. The project took roughly three months of work and lab time.
